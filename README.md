## What is Charting Library

Charting Library is a standalone solution for displaying charts. This free, downloadable library is hosted on your servers and is connected to your data feed to be used in your website or app. [Learn more and download](https://www.tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/?feature=technical-analysis-charts).
